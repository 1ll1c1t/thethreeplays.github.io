# The Three Plays — Top 25 Base Page

This is the starter you asked for: a **Top 25 games** picker page. Tap ★ to flag the matchups we'll cover, then on Sunday we'll add per‑game pages with the three decisive plays.

## Files
- `index.html` — Top 25 picker with filters and localStorage ★ picks
- `styles.css` — base styles
- `assets/logo-t3p.svg`, `assets/favicon.svg` — brand assets

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1) Create a new repo and upload this folder's contents (keep the `assets` folder).  
2) Settings → Pages → Source: `main`, root.  
3) Optional: add a `CNAME` file with `thethreeplays.com` and set Porkbun DNS.  
4) Enable HTTPS.

## Next
We'll add `/games/{slug}.html` templates on Sunday and wire the “Add highlights Sunday” link to them.
