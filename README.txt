Three Plays â€” Full Site Bundle
------------------------------
This includes every file you need:
- index.html (homepage with scoreboard + falling team logos + GA tag)
- assets/three-plays.css (styles), assets/three-plays.js (falling logos), assets/scoreboard.js (renders /data/scoreboard.json)
- assets/logos/*.png (placeholders; replace with real logos keeping the same filenames)
- data/scoreboard.json (edit totals here)
- writeups/*.pdf (your game writeups; already linked from the game pages)
- week-2/index.html, week-2/ucla-vs-unlv.html, week-2/arizona-st-vs-mississippi-st.html
- templates/game-template.html (duplicate for future games)

Deploy:
1) Copy everything to your repo root (thethreeplays.github.io). Overwrite existing files.
2) Commit and push.
3) Update data/scoreboard.json after games.
